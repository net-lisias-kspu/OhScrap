> You see, I forgot to take her shiny new ship for a test flight before sending it to space, so the reaction wheels failed. Then her oxygen started venting into space. So she quickly burned retrograde and started her re-entry. Except that as she came into land, the parachute failed too. Like I said, not a good day.

Sound exciting? Then why don't you install Oh Scrap! today.

Features

- Part Failures: Parachutes, Engines, Gimbals, Resources, Batteries, Reaction Wheels, Control Surfaces - all these failures can make your day turn out like Vals. (all can be disabled or enabled through the difficulty settings menu)
- Failures follow the [bathtub curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathtub_curve) - brand new untested parts are more likely to fail than pre-tested models. If you re-use a part too many times though, it will reach the end of it's shelf-life and be more prone to failure.
- Subsequent "new models" of parts become more reliable than their earlier counterparts. Ie, a part you've just researched is more likely to fail than a part that has been tried and tested many times - even if it's brand new.
- Repairs - some parts can be repaired remotely, some need an EVA. You always have a better chance of repairing a part on EVA

The maintainers/authors of DangIt - most of this would never have happened without looking at your code to figure out how to make stuff work.

CHECK YOU HAVE SCRAPYARD AND MODULE MANAGER INSTALLED FIRST



A note to CKAN USERS:
 

      Quote

    Kerbal Changelog is not a hard dependency, in that "Oh Scrap will load just fine without it".

    However, on CKAN it is a dependency.

    When I make a serious save / mod breaking change, CKAN will happily update you without you ever seeing a changelog. This means you could happily load your save, not notice the major version number has changed, and seriously break something. I do not like this. So CKAN users must use Kerbal Changelog, because that way nobody can say they weren't warned :).

 What mods are:

### Requires:
- [KSP]()
- [ScrapYard](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/178641-*)  to keep track of how many times a part has been built/recovered so that is a hard dependency. (obtained separately)

### Depends:
- [Module Manager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-*) is required if you want the mod to actually do anything. (obtained separately)
- []()

### Recomends:
- []()

### Suggests:
- [Kerbal Construction Time](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/182877-*) designed with this with in mind, so would recommend that mod (make sure you use the latest dev version)
- [KRASH]()
- [FAR]()
- [RemoteTech]()
- [StageRecovery]() If you plan to actually re-use your parts (and have them fail), you'll probably want StageRecovery too

### Supports:
- [Kerbal Changelog]()
- [USI MKS]()

### Conflicts:
- []()

### Replaces:
- [none]()
